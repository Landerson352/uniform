			<div class="pixel-based">This block doesn't flex at all. This is how we used to design in the early 2000s. It's ok if all you care about is desktop.</div>
			<div class="liquid">This block is liquid. This is how we've had to design for the past decade. It is evil and we should stop.</div>
			<div class="uniform-layout">This block is always the same size relative to the screen. This is great for making graphical layouts that are the same on every device.</div>
			<div class="uniform-component">This block is internally consistent on each screen size. This is great for re-usable, text-rich components that are different sizes on different devices, but always about the same physical size.</div>
