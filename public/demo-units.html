			<div class="pixel-based"><b>Pixels.</b> This block doesn't flex at all. This is how we used to design in the early 2000s. It's ok if you only really care about one screen size.</div>

			<div class="liquid"><b>Liquid.</b> This block is stretches and squishes unpredictably based on the available space, because the contents don't flex. This is how we've had to design for the past decade. It is evil and we should stop.</div>

			<div class="uniform-layout"><b>Uniform layout.</b> This block is always the same size relative to the screen. This is great for making graphical layouts that are the same on every device.</div>

			<div class="uniform-component"><b>Uniform component.</b> This block is internally consistent on each screen size. This is great for re-usable, text-rich components that are different sizes on different devices, but always about the same physical size.</div>
