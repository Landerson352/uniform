			<div class="pixel-based"><b>Pixels.</b> This block doesn't flex at all. It's ok if you only really care about one screen size.</div>

			<div class="liquid"><b>Liquid.</b> This block is stretches and squishes unpredictably based on the available space, because the contents don't flex. It works great for data-centric apps but wrecks graphical compositions.</div>

			<div class="uniform-layout"><b>Uniform layout.</b> This block is always the same size relative to the screen. This is great for making graphical layouts that are exactly the same on every device, just scaled up or down.</div>

			<div class="uniform-component"><b>Uniform component.</b> This block is internally consistent on each screen size. This is great for re-usable, text-rich components that are different sizes on different devices, but always about the same physical size. (ie. "About 2-4 inches wide")</div>
